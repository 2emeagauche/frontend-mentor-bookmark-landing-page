## My process

### Built with

- **Tailwindcss**
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla css

### What I learned

This challenge is part of the course about css frameworks: Bootstrap and Tailwindcss.
I choose Tailwindcss to complete the challenge.
It was very challenging as the html get so messy with all these classes.

### Continued development

I would like to learned why Tailwindcss is so trendy.
I clearly don't know how to work DRY with it and I would like to learn the best practices with Tailwindcss.
